  :title: "Cartoon: Apple Tablet: Now With Barometer and Bird Call Generator"
  :feed: http://www.readwriteweb.com/rss.xml
  :lede: I'm just aching to know if the new Apple tablet (insert caveats, weasel words and qualifiers here) is a potential Cintiq competitor. I don't think it will be, but you never know. It may also have a built in barometer and bird call generator. I'm never sure if Apple does themselves more good than harm with the secrecy and anticipation that surrounds the run-up to these announcements.

  :lede: "Separation of concerns between Factor VM and library codeThe Factor VM implements an abstract machine consisting of a data heap of objects, a code heap of machine code blocks, and a set of stacks. The VM loads an image file on startup, which becomes the data and code heap. It then begins executing code in the image, by calling a special startup quotation.When new source files are loaded into a running Factor instance by the developer, they are parsed and compiled into a collection of objects -- words, quotations, and other literals, along with executable machine code."

Released under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this document sets out 15 specific recommendations for national governments to implement in order to stem the widespread abuse of tax loopholes by multinational companies. At the center of the issue has been the asymmetry between tightly integrated global corporations and the fragmented, piecemeal responses from individual states.
